# Predicting-bay-area-house-prices

I would be predicting bay area house prices in this project. i would be taking data from Bay area housing dataset and zillow. This data has been recorded fron January 2013 and december 2015

First of all there are attributes like z_info and z_estimate which are price estimated by zillow and we wont need this as we dont want to affect our model by it
